# What is git?

.right-column-third[.right[<i class="fab fa-git fa-5x"></i>]]

*Decentralized version control system* for [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)

???
version control system: source code is usually **plain text** -> `.py`, `.tex`, `.marshmallow`...

--

- a clean history
- changes between versions
- easy collaborative development
- reset to a previous versions
- online backup

--

It is a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) under [GNU General Public License version 2.0](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source)

# Why use it?

Several use cases:
- <i class="fas fa-user-alt fa-2x" style="color:#4C4B4C"></i> with <i class="fas fa-laptop fa-2x" style="color:#4C4B4C"></i>: **versioning**,

git scales ! from your article/proto code to Linux kernel and Windows

# How does it work?

## Centralized vs Distributed ~~(Subversion vs git)~~

# How does it work?

## Git is *distributed*

So you can add a remote repository with <i class="fab fa-github-alt fa-2x" style="color:#4C4B4C"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com), <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-2x" style="color:#4C4B4C"></i> [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), <i class="fab fa-bitbucket fa-2x" style="color:#4C4B4C"></i> [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities)

## Bonus: Web interfaces

.footnote[[sources: github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-a-repository-s-network/)]

???
Let us say that we have an installed git repository, local and remote.

# Local repository

## Staging area

.right-column-half[![full](https://git-scm.com/images/about/index1@2x.png)]

- Untracked files needs to be *added* to be seen by git to be staged
- A modified file needs to be *added* to the repository to be staged
- Added files need to be *committed* to the repository

### Why a staging area?

- logical separation of changes to commit
- reviewing changes before commit

See this [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49228209/whats-the-use-of-the-staging-area-in-git) or this [one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4878358/why-would-i-want-stage-before-committing-in-git). Don't care? `git commit -a`

# Working with a remote

## Working with a remote 

- `git clone <url>`: download the remote repository
- `git pull`: download changes from remote
- `git push`: upload changes to remote

## Navigating between commits

- `git log`: view commit history
- `git checkout <commit-hash>`: take a look to old commit
- `git diff <commit-hash>`: show diff between present commit and `<commit-hash>`

# Conclusion

## To go further

A few more advanced concepts

- [Stashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning) 
- [Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
- [Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)

Collaborative work development is related to dealing with branch usually, a few examples of workflow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) or [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## To start

- To start on your computer: you need to setup git see [this](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup), but to sum up

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

- To create a repository: I suggest you first create the remote repository
